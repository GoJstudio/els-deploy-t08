      desc: `Bravo 10 is a small modular inverter offering many opportunities to design a solution that perfectly fits your needs.

      The ECI technology offers both AC and DC inputs to provide a perfect AC power while reducing the number of power conversion (the module operates under normal condition with the AC input delivering a 96% efficiency)!

      In conjunction with the DC input, it provides an excellent AC backup solution.`,
      application: `An ideal solution for securing small but critical AC loads, from 1.25 kVA to 40 kVA, such as telecom small cells (4G and 5G), access control, traffic
      lights, security, etc.`,
      feature: `AC and DC input sources, 1 to 32 modules and 1 or 3 phases configuration, Customization(manual by-pass and AC distribution), Transfer time reduced to 0 ms, Compact design`,

      desc: `Bravo 6 is a small modular inverter offering many opportunities to design a solution that perfectly fits your needs.

      From 1 to 4 modules, with several options available (manual external by-pass and AC distribution), the Bravo 6 modular inverter is also hotswappable meaning a very easy and cheap maintenance.

      The modules are delivered with our new monitoring solution.`,
      application: `An ideal solution for securing small but critical AC loads, from 750 VA to 3 kVA, such as telecom small cells (4G and 5G), access control, traffic lights, security, etc.`,

      desc: `BRAVO is a compact and scalable modular inverter providing a pure sine wave AC supply. In conjunction with a DC Power system, it provides an excellent AC backup solution. It uses the latest inverter technology, providing superior energy efficiency in a compact size.

      The ECI technology eliminates all single points of failure with full scalability; up to 32 modules in parallel and high efficiency of up to 96% in AC to AC conversion, and above 93.5% in DC/AC conversion, hence reducing operating costs. We can build the systems up to 2.7 MVA.`,
      application: `All business critical applications and all types of AC loads. The design is modular and scalable with hot- swappable inverter modules which ensures low Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), reduction in service costs and meets the changing needs for future expansion.`,
      feature: `Extra AC input for increased efficiency, Compact design, Up to 2.7 MVA, 1P or 3P infrastructure, No disturbances on DC loads & batteries`,

      desc: `With dimensions of 1U x 342 mm x 221 mm, the e-one occupies just 3,300 cm³ while our competitors’ products are almost double the size. e-one provides a perfect AC output (pure sine wave) that lets your critical loads to work their best.

      We also guarantee a very low ripple voltage compliant with the telecom standard. In practical terms, this means almost no disturbances reach your DC load or batteries; a great benefit as disturbances considerably reduce battery life.`,
      application: `e-one is the ideal solution for powering and securing any AC equipment: telecommunication, mass transport, and many others.`,
      feature: `e-one 10 - 48/230 is a stand-alone inverter capable of converting a 48 Vdc power source into a pure sine wave of 230 Vac at 50 Hz.`,
