    desc: `AGIL is a compact and scalable modular UPS providing a pure sine wave AC Supply.
    The “Twin Sine Innovation” (TSI) technology ensures independent “hot pluggable and hot swap” modules that include virtually all functions of a conventional UPS (AC/DC, DC/AC, battery charger, Static Switch), eliminating all potential single points of failure.
    Up to 29 modules can be installed in parallel to bring the full output power potential to 580 kVA.`,

    desc: `Bravo 10 is a small modular inverter offering many opportunities to design a solution that perfectly fits your needs.
    The ECI technology offers both AC and DC inputs to provide a perfect AC power while reducing the number of power conversion (the module operates under normal condition with the AC input delivering a 96% efficiency)!
    In conjunction with the DC input, it provides an excellent AC backup solution.`,
